To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist


To open the file, use the built-in open() function.

The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file


Read Only Parts of the File:

By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many character you want to return:

Example:

Return the 5 first characters of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))

Read Lines:

You can return one line by using the readline() method:

Example:

Read one line of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())

By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:

Example:

Read two lines of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
print(f.readline())

By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:

Example:

Loop through the file line by line:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
for x in f:
  print(x)
