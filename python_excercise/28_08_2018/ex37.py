# "as" is used to create an alias while importing a module. It means giving a diffrent name to a module while importing it.

# As for example, Python has a standard module called math. Suppose we want to calculate what cosine pi is using an alias. We can do it as follows using as:

import math as m1
a = m1.cos(m1.pi)

print a

# if, elif, else are used for conditional branching or decision making.
